# RAVEN
Open-source MIDI device schematics + code for the musician on a budget. Drumpad code based loosely off of my "Emergency Queer Pep Talk" device code.

## Concept:
RAVEN is a series of open-source, DIY MIDI solutions for those on a budget. This isn't meant to be the most elegant solution in the world, but it can be made for next to nothing using parts that would normally end up in a landfill, so it turns out to be a fairly eco-friendly and budget-conscious option.

There will be 3 different versions for the drumpad, with RAVEN Micro intended to be the first released project.

RAVEN (64-key)
RAVEN Mini (32-key)
RAVEN Micro (16-key)

RAVEN Workstation - A portable DAW, meant to be thrown in your backpack (or cargo pants pocket) with your RAVEN variant.

The schematics for the keyboard will be loose, as I intend for them to be mostly universal, minus some code modification you'll most likely have to do for your specific keyboard matrix.

## Required Items:
- Arduino Pro Micro or compatible ATMega32u4 board.
- Landline keypad or similar 4x4 matrix keypad(s) to use the drumpad code, or an electronic toy keyboard to use the keyboard code.
- Soldering iron and wire.
- (Optional) I2C 16x2 LCD module to display currently playing chord/note/keypad.

## TODO:
- Post schematics and code once prototype is developed.
