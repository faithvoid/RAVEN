# RAVEN
Open-source MIDI device schematics + code.

#Concept:
RAVEN is an open-source, DIY MIDI solution for those on a budget. This isn't the most elegant solution in the world, but it can be made for next to nothing using parts that would normally end up in a landfill.

#Required Items:
- Arduino Pro Micro or compatible board
- Landline keypad or similar 4x4 matrix keypad to use the drumpad code, or an electronic toy keyboard to use the keyboard code.
- Soldering iron and wire
