# RAVEN Workstation
Open-source DAW schematics, intended to be a near-pocket-sized portable DAW.

## Required Items:
- Raspberry Pi (any model will do, but newer versions will yield better performance)
- 7" 640x470 Touchscreen LCD
- Soldering iron and wire.
- 3D Printer
- SD card image, once available (or make your own with your preferred Linux distro and DAW software!)

## TODO:
- Post schematics and code once prototype is developed.
